This is instructional code to parse the Java Script Object Notation (JSON) data from any URL Using Asynchronous Java Script And XML (AJAX) 

# what is AJAX
Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh. The best definition I've read for Ajax is “the method of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.”


# Features of AJAX

- It make web page faster.
- Independent of server technology.
- Increase the Performance of web page.
- No need to pushing on a submit button and reloading the complete website.
- No need to reload the whole page only some part of page is reloaded which is required to reload.
- Apart from obtaining the XMLHTTP object, all processing is same for all browser types, because JavaScript is used.
- Using ajax develop faster and more interactive web applications.
- Not require to completely reload page due to this server use less bandwidth.
